<h2>TESTIMONIALS</h2>

<h3> Charles </h3>

What attracted us to Yourmmcclure Designs in the first place was that you offered an exciting range of products. We were looking for bedroom furniture for a room that was not very large but was very tall. We also wanted furniture that made a statement and that would bring colour into our lives. The Lago NOW range worked on both levels. The flexibility of size of the furniture met our needs perfectly and we were able to select furniture that fitted perfectly into the space we had available. Unlike many other furniture ranges, the NOW range came in a variety of heights so we were able to find wardrobes that made effective use of the height of our room and the fact that they came with a sliding door option meant that access to them was no problem. You also offered chests of drawers that were the perfect depth for the space into which we were going to fit them. The range of colours and finishes was incredible. The frosted glass finish on which we settled as unavailable elsewhere.


The quality of the product was matched with the thoroughness of the design and installation service. Although I had provided a floor plan, Yourmmcclure Designs made a site visit and carried out extensive measurements before settling down with us to work out the best use of the space we had available. When further decisions had to be made we were consulted properly. Visiting your showroom was always a pleasure, your staff making us feel welcome and going out of their way to try to meet our needs. The installation went very smoothly. Your staff were efficient and polite and went out of their way to consult us on the fine details of the installation. The furniture works exceptionally well and meets our needs perfectly.


The only problem we encountered was arranging fitting because the proposed date did not give us enough time to arrange payment of the balance and dispose of our old furniture. Fortunately, Yourmmcclure Designs were able to fit us into a cancellation and we only spent a few days living out of boxes.

Yourmmcclure Designs has an amazing range of high quality contemporary furniture.  In re-doing our flat, we had a particular vision for the look and flow for our main living areas, and the Yourmmcclure Designs design team and products allowed us to realise it to perfection. The high gloss modular units that we selected provide a bold yet neat and airy feel to the space, while giving us all the necessary utility essential for day-to-day living and entertaining.

As much as we are thrilled with our purchases, what truly sets Yourmmcclure Designs apart is the attention to details from its talented staff.  From the onset, our appointed Yourmmcclure Designs interior decorator took the time to get to know us and what we were hoping to achieve.  He then explored a variety of creative ideas and layouts which ultimately helped us to decide on the optimal scheme.

Last, but certainly not least, the installation went smoothly and was done to a very professional standard.  

I think it goes without saying, that we would not hesitate to recommend Yourmmcclure Designs to our family and friends, and will be using them again whenever the need arises.

We are delighted with the two sofas and tables which were delivered and very
efficiently installed. Thank you to Kate who designed them, and the two
gentlemen who delivered and set them up. I'll come into the shop when I am
next in U.S, as interested in pursuing a rug, as discussed with Kate.
