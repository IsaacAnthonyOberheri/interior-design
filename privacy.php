		<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
<h4>Last Updated on January 31, 2020</h4>
PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY. BY ACCESSING AND USING THIS WEBSITE, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THIS PRIVACY POLICY IN ITS ENTIRETY. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY, PLEASE DO NOT USE OUR WEBSITE.
The website  yourmccluredesigns.org (the “Site”) is brought to you by  yourmccluredesigns.org Inc. (“ yourmccluredesigns.org,” “we,” “us,” or “our”). This Privacy Policy provides information about our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information received through the Site from visitors and registered users of the Site (the “Privacy Policy”). This Privacy Policy is incorporated into, and is part of, our Terms of Use which govern your access to the Site and/or your use of the Site and of the Content (as defined in the Terms of Use) and the services made available on or through the Site (collectively, the “Services”). Unless otherwise defined herein, capitalized terms shall have the meaning assigned to such terms in the Terms of Use. If you have comments, suggestions, questions, or concerns about our Privacy Policy, please contact us at support@yourmccluredesigns.org.
<h2>WHAT INFORMATION IS COLLECTED ON THE SITE</h2>
<h2> A. Information You Provide To Us. </h2>
When you visit our Site, we may collect your e-mail address if you provide it to us voluntarily in order to contact you about the Services. While some items are optional, most are required for legal and security purposes. To sign up as a registered user of our Services (“Registered User”) and access the User Restricted Areas (as defined in the Terms of Use), you have to create a user account and provide the following personal information to us during the registration process: your name, your e-mail address and your phone number. You may also provide to us voluntarily information about your investment profile, such as, income level, return expectations, net worth, investment experience, desired investment term, areas of investment interest. If you contact us by email, we may keep a record of your contact information and correspondence, and may use your email address, and any information that you provide to us in your message, to respond to you.
<h3> a. Financial Data. </h3>
Registered Users who use our Services to make an investment in our offerings will be asked to provide certain financial data, such as your bank account number and bank routing number. This information is required to enable us or our payment processor, SynapseFI (see the SynapseFI Privacy Policy for more information on how that data may be used) and our banking partners, Evolve Bank & Trust and Esquire Bank, to utilize your bank account to originate funds transfers and make subsequent investment disbursements to you. Because SynapseFI will perform services related to the offering, transaction and processing of payments, your personal information will be shared with SynapseFI and will be subject to the SynapseFI Privacy Policy. For purposes of satisfying “Know Your Customer” requirements, we ask for your address and use the Google Maps API for that purpose (see the Google Privacy Policy for more information on how that data may be used). If you choose to use our referral service to invite a friend to the Service, we will ask you for that person’s email address or import your existing contacts, and automatically send an email invitation.  Yourmcclure Designs stores this information to send this email, to register your friend if your invitation is accepted and to track the success of our invitation service.
<h2> B. Information We Collect About Your Interaction with the Site.</h2>
We collect additional information about your interaction with the Site without identifying you as an individual (“Anonymous Information”), by using cookies on our Site. For example, we receive certain standard information that your browser sends to every website you visit, such as your IP address, browser type and language, access times and referring website addresses. We may use Anonymous Information for any purpose in our discretion. For clarity, Anonymous Information means information that is not associated with or linked to your personal information and does not permit the identification of individual persons.
<h2> HOW INFORMATION COLLECTED ON THE SITE IS USED AND SHARED </h2>

As with any other business, it is possible that in the future we could merge with or be acquired by another company. If such an acquisition occurs, the successor company would have access to the Information, but would continue to be bound by this Privacy Policy unless and until it is amended.
